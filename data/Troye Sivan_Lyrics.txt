What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya
And it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby
I guess it's something like a fun fair
Put gas into the motor
And boy I'll meet you right there
We'll ride the rollercoaster
'Cause it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Now it's the perfect season
Yeah, let's go for it this time
We're dancing with the trees and
I've waited my whole life
It's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Just for you
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
Every time it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Just for you
I bloom just for you
I bloom just for you
Just for you
I bloom just for you
Remember when we first met?
You said, "Light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mum and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Remember when you taught me fate?
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothin' on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hopin' that things would change
But we went right back to your games
Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
And even if I run away
Give my heart a holiday
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you, you
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Oh, our lives don’t collide, I’m aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things you like stick, and I like aerosol
I don’t give a fuck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Young ambition
Say we'll go slow, but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin’ every night with you
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we’ve already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just dance to this
Dance to this
We can just dance to this
Dear beloved
Bring those 501s a bit closer, bit closer
And dear, my lover
Do that thing we never do sober, sober
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
Oh, we don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just dance to this
Mm, mm
Dance to this
Mm
We can just dance to this
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
Don't take much to start me
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just
Don’t take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we’ve already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just dance to this
Dance to this, love
Dance to this
We can just dance to this
Dance to this, dance to this
We can just dance to this
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
I don’t wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
We can just dance to this
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
I don't wanna sleep tonight-night-night-night-night
I just wanna take that ride
We can just dance to this
I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand
That I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love
But I sympathize, and I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize, recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love, and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy, darlin'
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through
'Cause he made it easy, easy
What's left of the dance?
The smell on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darling
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darling
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, don't leave me
He made it easy, please, don't leave me
He made it easy, please, don't leave me
I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through
'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please, don't leave me, no, don't leave me
He made it easy
Please, don't leave me
He made it easy
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
Yeah, it drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild
White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now
'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
Yeah, it drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake, bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake, bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
Yeah, it drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face, and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need
The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate, my mind in its cage
And numb what I see
Awake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some relief
This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me free
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?
The truth runs wild
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump-starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you
We try staying up late
But we both are lightweights
Yeah, we get off our face too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you
Eat a pill, stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart, it'd be an honour
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
Everybody loves you, baby
You should trademark your face
Linin' down the block to be around you
But, baby, I'm first in place
Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Look at you
Skip the application interview
Sweet like Marabou
Look, look at you
Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
But nobody wants you bad as I do
Baby, let me plead my case, yeah
Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Lo-lo-look at you
Pop the culture, iconography
Is standin' right in front of me
Look, lo-look at you
Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls
Aah
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
'Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3-AM shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
'Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw the line when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal
I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Grey areas and expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you
But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics, something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't gеt any better
Started giving up on thе word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret and, baby, I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite
You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn
And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite
Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, 'cause who's got any time for growing up?
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me on the mouth, free
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire
So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Love hits hard, I know
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I can't say no
Though the lights are on
There's nobody home
Swore I'd never lose control
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear-blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
Oh, I wanna know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I wanna skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water
And my boy, like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better
'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Tell me all the ways to love you, oh
Tell me all the ways to love you
Oh, I wanna tiptoe through your bliss, boy
Get lost the more I find ya
Oh, don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer
And my boy, like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better
'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Tell me all the ways to love you, oh
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go
Breathe me in, exhale slow
Take me to anywhere you wanna go
'Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
'Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Tell me all the ways to love you, oh
Tell me all the ways to love you, yeah
Tell me all the ways
Tell me all the ways
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Pass your boy the heatwave, recreate the sun
Take me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket gun
My body blazin'
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mummy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been out here for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown
Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin
Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into
The unknown, unknown
Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin
Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me, switch the lights, oh, oh
And happiness
Is right there where you lost it when you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it tryna win in a losing game?
Well, it's all waiting for you
And boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah
I'm tired of the city, scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die, let's die somewhere pretty, ah, ah-ah
Sad in the summer, city needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time, then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take yourself home
Home, oh
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep, but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
You should know I'm green, but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I can't keep my hands off you
While you're lying awake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
An ode to the boy I love
Boy, I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to?
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby, that's you
Baby, that's
Baby, that's you, you-you
I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights
Oh oh, take in it all
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the world we've manifested-fested
Oh oh, just take in it all
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you
Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
I'm just some dumb kid
Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit together
So go, get to runnin', won't you hurry?
While it's light out, while it's early
Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whatever
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I'll leave you one last kiss on your pillow
Before I fly away
Yeah, we knew from the beginning
That this wasn't never ending
Shouldn't stay too long
'Cause we're both too young
To give into forever
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy
I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run-around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh, now
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Jealous, you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead, I’m wasting my time just pressing rewind
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding, holding on, oh
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Maybe we're overgrown
The sweetest plum
The sweetest plum
Sweet life living
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars with you
Fat cigars and
And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?
Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart
But she sold it off for
And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?
When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?
When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah
I was just trying to be cool
Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine
Play it back and press rewind
To when you traced your fingers, drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around
When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broke
You take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes, I still see your ghost
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around
I don't keep love around, ye-eah
I don't keep love around, ooh yeah
I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around
They can't stand, I handstand
Don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall Flash Dance?
Only A1 and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I’m still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the light on and you don't keep love
"Distance makes the heart grow fonder’"
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now? Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it, I still see you way up here, yeah
I'm stressed about it
Went west about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
No way around it; I still hear you crystal clear
But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
It's the hardest thing I've said
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere
But I can't let you in again
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
That's the hardest thing I've said
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
But I can't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said, you know
That's the hardest thing I've said
Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
Would've thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
But you still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah
I sent you a postcard from Tokyo, baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck
'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between
Yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need
Yeah
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
I remember that night that you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck
Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between
Yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need
Yeah
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Take your time, pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers of doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about
But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
Yeah, you're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
He's got the personality not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah
Inching closer to sunrise
Now we're standin' eye to eye
I wanna tell you what's on my—
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Yeah, yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
We've got that hot chemistry, yeah, you and me won't make it out this house
Inching closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side
On my mind
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Boy, can I be honest?
Yeah
We got somethin' to give each other
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Growing distance, free of explanation
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplation
I'd rather be spittin' blood
Than have this silence fuck me up
This separation, time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew
Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Used to give each other the world, every bit
Used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust
And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you've muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
Than feel myself turn to stone
Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
I don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to fight
Anything but quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Hey, you
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are
I just wanna go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Living a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around
Hey, you
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are, yeah
I just wanna do some shit just to try
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Living in a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around
Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh, I'm so scared
It's just for tonight
So I take a sip, wait till it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need
So I take a sip, wait till it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
Wasted on you
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
We wrote a life all by ourselves
Wish I could put it back on the shelf
But there's a dazzling wave that keeps me at bay with you, my love
I ride this one all by myself
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out, yeah
Yeah, I guess I'm 'bout to find out
We took a trip and made the best
We laughed and played, then laid to rest
But life's a blackening wave drifting us further than we are
And now we're knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
Well, don't you want to see the world, boy?
All the countries and their stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh, I swear you'll feel alive, boy
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun
When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
Till they put you in the ground, boy
All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun, let's go have fun
Let's go have fun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day…
Fun, you and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
In the mid-day sun
You and me in the old jeep
Ridin' 'round town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shootin' at rocks bullets cocked
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, tough
What's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not
But could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you, a stud to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Taking the fun out of fucks
Searching for something I'm not
Knowing that you're not the one
How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this right
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this, right?
Right?
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
The seven hundred miles
Down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this
My night
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
'Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualise
The greener skies on the other side
So tell me, how am I gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools?
But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there till I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out on the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did
The pain
It's determined and demanding to ache,
But I'm okay…
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you
You lost a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you it's time to go
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you
And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you
Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest
Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
The time's moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer, yeah
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach out and touch
My mind's gone a-racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump, yeah, I'm ready to swim
Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
Your hands need to build them
My mind's gone running
My hands cut loose
But there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do
And I need you to trust that I'm lost
And we must get past all these rules
We must choose to reach out and touch
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
In total darkness I reach out and
Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam to the curl of your lips
And the centre of eclipse
God, I wish it was you
Troye, baby
Last night was fucking crazy
No, no, no, anoche, una puta locura
Una puta locura
What the fuck?
Tokyo just hit me like a wave
Where we ended up, I couldn't say
I'm feelin' like my head's just in a distant time and place
I hope that I got you the way that you got me, baby
And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then, oh, you showed, and that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know
Is what's the time where you are, you are?
What's the night like where you are, you are?
International straight shot to my heart
Is it better where you are, you are?
What's the weather where you are, you are?
International through line to my heart
God, I wish it was you
Anoche, una puta locura
Una puta locura
What the fuck?
'Cause I'm everywhere, you'd think I'm on the run
You know that I got you the way that you got me, baby
And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Now the only thing I wanna know
Is what's the time where you are, you are?
What's the night like where you are, you are?
International straight shot to my heart
Is it better where you are, you are?
What's the weather where you are, you are?
International through line to my heart
God, I wish it was you
Troye, baby
No, no, no, anoche, una puta locura
Una puta locura
What the fuck?
You are, you are
You are, you are
Got an international through line to my heart
Confundo la realidad
Y es que todo me extasía
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías
So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías
Am I fucking sixteen?
This shit's kinda depressin'
All you're doin' to me
'Cause you mess me, test me, wreck me, oh, yeah
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, oh, yeah
I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Tus espuelas con las mías
So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías
Y aunque esté partida
Tu mirada es genuina
Sé que estás pensando
Carnavaleando
Has dado en el blanco
Dientes en el canto
Que la carne fría
I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or, yeah
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Tus espuelas con las mías
So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, oh, yeah
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mías
I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head
I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, tryna forget it
Feel this emptiness in my chest
I feel surreal but I'm feeling stressed
I need to do something
Fucked up for nothing
Oh, I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline
Wake up the morning after
You call, but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try
You deserve forever
Not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I will try to keep you near
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Oh no, like gasoline
Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire
Like gasoline
Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
With infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
We're alright, 'cause
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
Can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew you
This is me you're talkin' 'bout
Your only friend
Put your love into the ground
On my big weekend
While I was singin' songs about you
On the TV screen
Don't know how he left the hotel
I wasn't there to see
In the morning
Your hands around my waist, just us two
In the evening
On my mouth, could you still taste him?
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could but you can't go
I wish you weren't dead to me
So much to miss in you
More than just my enemy
You were my lover too
And I hope you forgive yourself
Because I swear I do
And it breaks my heart to say
I can't wait to live without you
In the morning
Yeah, I wake up with the sun across my face
In the evening
Yeah, I lay with so much love to take your place
And now I
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could but you can't go
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Cut my hair into a bowl after you told me that you liked it like that
Wish I didn't care at all but now I'm in the mirror with scissors in hand
I saw you at a party, said hello like an old colleague
Talked about the summer when we didn't know each other
Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know
I still got it bad
I still got it bad
And I still want it bad
Got a place back in Australia, it's different than you remember
You touch mе in the back seat of the party bus on Tеnth Street
Kinda confused me, both a couple drinks in too deep, it
Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know
I still got it bad
I still got it bad
Yeah, I still want it bad
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Now I want it back
'Cause you still got it
Still got it
Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine
We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
We're taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
I don't care if it's taking all night
It's alright, it's alright
We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
We're taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright
So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?

Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Nothing wrong 'cause we know when to stop

Something wrong 'bout to keep in on top
Cut my garden down
I've got no flowers, but it's the thought that counts
Wish you lived a little closer
Maybe when we're a little older
We can set up shop, ah
Back where you are or I can take you home
I feel like my brother might like you
Just not in the same way I do, yeah
Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop
I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a littlе bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give mе one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you
I turn my bussy out
It's been a sec, but I didn't forget
How to pull you in closer
In case it's not till we're older
That we reach the top
The pinnacle of everything we are
I feel like my mother might like you
Just not in the same way I do
Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions impair my decisions
And I can't stop
I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you, yeah
Startin' again when I got all I wanted
Startin' to feel a little bit despondent, yeah
Yeah
Startin' again when I got all I wanted
We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack
You make up
We make a really good team
And though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichés on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
And sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you
We're not a commercial for everyone else
We go out for coffee and keep it to ourselves
We make little homes out of three star hotels
I know what you're feeling cause I feel it as well
You don't have to say I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
I'm still in it like that
Baby, I'm a love junkie like that
I'm so silly like that
Can you hit me back?
'Cause you really know me
But you don't wanna know me
Aah-ooh, aah-ooh
All the bodies on the floor collide
Everybody's out here lookin' right
The party's the only place that really knows me
I'm just tryna get outside of this body
I still love you more than I should say
I'm just tryna put that shit away
Don't need anybody here to console me
I'm just tryna get outside of this—
I'm still in it like that
Baby, I'm a love junkie like that
I'm so silly like that
Can you hit me back?
'Cause you really know me
But you don't wanna know me

But you don't wanna know me
Aah-ooh, aah-ooh, yeah

La-la-la-la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe
You know
I see love in every space
I see sex in every city, every town
I wonder what us two could make
'Cause I feel so good around you
Can you imagine what we'd get up to? Yeah
There's something different about tonight
I could speak, or just let my body explain
I'm getting close to satisfied
And I've learned so much about you
Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to, yeah
Overdrive
My body's workin' in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
Give me that honey, honey, love, you've got the recipe
I don't pray a lot, God knows
But I'm callin' in favours like I believe
Don't go bringin' me that close
'Cause I feel so good around you
I'm going in tonight like I love you, yeah
Overdrive
My body's workin' in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean, yeah
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream, yeah
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean, yeah
I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you
And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
Love in America, got me down
Try take off running but hit the ground
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take
And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants
Here he comes
Like he just walked out of a dream
Doesn't care you're seventeen
Or maybe he forgot what that means
But here he comes
In my free
In my wild
In my dark
Oh I started
Started to doubt
Doubt this fire
Lighting up our lives
And it kept me up at night
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon
Which one of us went and fucked up
You or me, guess it was me
Don't know a good thing when its right infront of me
‘Cause I’m so numb, what have I become?
Oh, cause' crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue moon
My blue moon
Crash and burn
That's all I know
I think that’s why I made you go
Those three words
You were my first
I can’t help thinking
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
How did I come to lose my blue
Maybe you were my blue moon?
Maybe I let go too soon?
Running from what could be
So terrified of happy
June Haverly
You always get your way
But, June Haverly
Not today
No, not today
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star
Burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly
You always got your way
But not today
No, not today
June Haverly
You're not to blame
No, not to blame
And, June Haverly
Don't be ashamed
For all the pain
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star
Burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh, why'd you go?
You're on top of the world
Just trying to stay on track
And they'll kiss your feet
While they stab your back
And watch your star
Burn to blaze and cry
June Haverly
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it’s all working out, now
‘Cause there’s still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I’ve been a fool
Ow yeah
You're driving me
White noise in my mind
Won’t calm down
You’re all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light’s out
It’s me and you now, now
‘Cause there’s still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I’ve been a fool
Ow yeah
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, never
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, never
Heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You’re driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You’re driving me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You’re driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
I seen you with your other dude
He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain
Because no matter how my life has changed
I just keep on looking back on better days
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
I promise
I swear to you, I'll be okay
You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
She's 22 and she's loving you
And you'll never know that it makes me blue
Does she make you happy?
I'm holding on to everything that's wrong
Cause we don't belong, you like my songs
And it makes me happy
Does she make you happy?
You can throw away every word I say
I'm standing still on this hidden hill
And I'm looking around for the right way down
To your distant valley
Your flowers grow in the frozen snow
And I'd like to know, is it all a show?
Are you really happy? Are you really happy?
Cause you can throw away every word I say
You just throw awayYou might also like1Embed13 ContributorsSomebody to Love LyricsCan anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
I work hard
Every day of my life
I work til' I ache in my bones
At the end of the day
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Til' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord
Somebody
Ooh somebody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me
Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
But when the sun starts to set
And when the skies take your breath
And I need to sense you right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there
Only the Lord knows why it's not there
But when the sun starts to set
And when the skies take your breath
And I need to sense you right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
I can't make you love me, yeah
I can't make you love me
But when the sun starts to set
And when the skies take your breath
And I need to sense you right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Pass your boy the heatwave, rеcreate the sun
Takе me to the feeling, boy, you know the one
Kiss it when you're done, man, this shit is so much fun
Pocket rocket gun
My body blazin'
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
It's so good, it's so good
We got something to give each other
Yeah, we got something to give each other
Don't matter to me, forever a week, baby, I want it all
Tell me to speed off with the heat, I'm gonna take the call
We got something
We got something to give each other
So good when we slow gravity, so good
So good when we slow gravity, so good
What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours
My sweet Lord
Oh, my Lord
Mm, my Lord
I really wanna see you

But it takes so long, my Lord
My sweet Lord
My, my, my Lord

That it won't take long, my Lord
I really wanna see you

I really wanna see you, Lord
But it won't take long, my Lord
I really wanna know you
I really wanna go with you
I really wanna show you, Lord
That it won't take long, my Lord
In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown
All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin
Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown
All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and
My happy little pill

Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin, yeah
Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
These bright lights, see these bright lights bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh yeah
Oh, all the glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, and dollar bills and
My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes

My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin baby
Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild
You’re driving me…
You’re driving me…
You’re driving me…
You’re driving me…
I hear gods, they fight an epic fight for you
I hear gods, their hearts break as they lose sight of you
I hear gods, I hear gods
Everyday, I'm looking for you and
Every night, I'm searching for truth
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not backing down into it
Woah-oh, but I hear gods
I hear gods
I hear gods
I hear gods
I hear gods
I hear gods
I hear gods
But I can't love what I can't understand
I'll make wars if nations will not follow you
I'll bring storms if they don't wanna love you like I do
I'll bring storms, I'll bring storms
Everyday, I'm looking for you and
Every night, I'm searching for truth
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not seeing it anywhere
I'm not backing down into it
Woah-oh, but I hear gods

This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed us by
We won't give up until we drink from the silver cup
After the last couple of years
I really thought that I like was incapable of feeling anything
For a long time
Just even to feel like a little bit of
Butterflies or, fucking, just feeling
I don't know what you did or how you did it
You said to me, you were like, um
"This is one of life's greatest pleasures"
And you know what? You were right
He's got the personality not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah
Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're standin' еye to eye
I wanna tеll you what's on my—
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Yeah, yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
We've got that hot chemistry, yeah, you and me won't make it out this house
Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side
On my mind
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
And I don't wanna go home alone, alright?
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Yeah
I want it, grip you tight
I've seen enough of your body
Come back and feel the vibe
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Boy, can I be honest?
Yeah
We got something to give each other
You just got me started
And I don't think I can stop it
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
Fuck it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Take a trip into my garden
I've got so much to show ya
The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya
And it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby
I guess it's something like a fun fair
Put gas into the motor
And boy I'll meet you right there
We'll ride the rollercoaster
'Cause it's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, baby
I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, you should know I
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
And when it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Now it's the perfect season
Yeah, let's go for it this time
We're dancing with the trees and
I've waited my whole life
It's true, baby
I've been saving this for you, now baby
But I need you to
Tell me right before it goes down
Promise me you'll
Hold my hand if I get scared now
Might tell you to
Take a second, baby, slow it down
You should know I, 'cause you should know I
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
And when it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Just for you
I bloom just for you
Yeah just for
I bloom just for you
Yeah just for
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Baby, baby, I've been saving this for you, baby
Come on, baby, play me like a love song
And when it comes on
I get this sweet desire
Just for you, you, you
Just for you, you, you
Just for you
Just for you
I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell, bring me back again
Play me the classics, something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret and baby I'll keep it
And maybe we can play at house for the weekend
You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah
I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word "forever"
Until you gave up heaven so we could be together
You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Valentines Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan-fic in the middle of the night
'Cause, you know, this will bring us closer, right?
"You've never met them," the peasant cried
Shut the **** up *****, do you want to die?
I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a GIF
OTP, we're my OTP
Baby, you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh
OTP, we're my OTP
Baby, you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh
Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels, right where it hurts
I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella
Almost

We'd be so sexy, oh
We'd be so sexy, oh
No, literally, the only thing that's stopping us
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

Made the whole world fill with rage
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde
Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out - Mr. Tom Daley
The world's realising that it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys
Robin Thicke went to Number 1
Even though the song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes
Everybody says she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray
But here we are asking What The Fox Say?
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year
The US Government needed a break
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes
The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss
Rest in peace to Nelson Mandela
To you Madiba, we're indebted forever
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick ass year
Oh and I, don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I, think I just shed a tear
So this is what everyone talks about
Bells and whistles and cologne
Thought I had everything figured out
That I could make it on my own
And now I'm living and can't live without
Another human by my side
Heard about it but I've had my doubts
Yeah, you put them on the side
So this is love?
This is enough
This is enough to feed my soul
So this is love?
This is enough
This is enough to make me whole
So this is love?
Been a while, waited for so long
Throw myself into the night
Then I find me in your eyes
Used to stand there in this window shop
Fog the glass up with my breath
Stare at buildings from the bottom of
Now the clouds are on my left
So this is love?
This is enough
This is enough to feed my soul
So this is love?
This is enough
This is enough to make me whole
So this is love?
So this is love?
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake
Only fools...
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all
I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children’s names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it’s my mistake

One Direction took over the world
All the boys and Harry's curly curls
And Obama’s back, I guess he's a hit
Thank you, US, cause Mitt Romney's a shit
Gangnam Style took over the tubes
The London Olympics were pretty huge
Drake told people You Only Live Once
Hashtag YOLO son
Carly Jepsen said call me maybe
And Justin said, that’s not my…
In 2012, ooh, in 2012
In 2012, aah, in 2012
Kony please stop acting like a prick
The producer of that played with his…
Cole Sprouse joined Tumblr, we said hello
But now he's just somebody that we used to know
Somebody, somebody
That dude Felix jumped from the sky
Everyone thought, “he's gonna die"
Swag, swag, swag on you
Personally, I started vlogging too!
In 2012, ooh, in 2012
In 2012, aah, in 2012
The world ended, we all got owned
Oh wait, shit, sorry, that was postponed

The líne between dream, reality, and nightmare has become so blurred.
I could cry just thinking about you.
I don't really know who I am anymore, with or without you.
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
The truth is...
You might also likeI've been lying to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breath
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?
And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, we’ll be fireproof

Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore

A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it’s all working out, now
‘Cause there’s still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I’ve been a fool
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I’ve never ever wanted to be so bad
It drives me wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
White noise in my mind
Won’t calm down
You’re all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light’s out
It’s me and you now, now
‘Cause there’s still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I’ve been a fool
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I’ve never ever wanted to be so bad
It drives me wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You’re driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You’re driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I’ve never ever wanted to be so bad
It drives me wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls

I've got you in the palm of my sweating hand
In the grip of a slipping man
Hanging on a string of confusion
And a hopeful illusion of my touch
Here we are now, here we go again
Here despite how you're not here for amusement
Or getting lost in the movement
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you
Can we dance until the end?
You're in the arms of a hurricane
Of a storm that I can't explain
You say my heart is a nuisance
But I'm only a human, and my love
Here we are now, here we go again
Here despite how you're not here for amusement
Or getting lost in the movement, yeah
I said I'm losing you
But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
I'll miss the way you move
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you

But we're dancing 'til the end
I know what's best to do
But the truth will just defend
And I know it's my demand
But if I'm losing you
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna let go
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up
You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'
I feel the rush

I'm picking up the pieces
And walking back into the light
Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes
My dreams came true, when I found you
I found you, my miracle
If you could see what I see
That you're the answer to my prayers
And if you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know, it would be clear
That angels brought me here

Feels like I've been born again
Every brеath is your love
