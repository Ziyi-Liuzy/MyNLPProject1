My thought around, I'm a little bit out
Maybe I do whatever, do it
Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls
Welcome to the club, my son
They can make it out house
Maybe a overgrown
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes'til all this treasure
And it drives me wild
'cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
'cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
'cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can’t turn away
And it’s driving me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You’re driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're make me love, wait, three
Never way little wanted to be
So much in my life
Why it's nothing to ya
Take yourself home
You were my first, I die
Sweat it back into
So this is love?
This is enough
This is enough to feel a soul
Come back and feel the vibe
Oh, baby, baby
Boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
**** it up just like this party did tonight
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby
Oh the boy, can I be honest?
Kinda miss usin' my body
I want it bad
Living up on my body, yeah
You know we've already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just dance to this
Dear beloved
Bring those 501s one to be face
I'm so in your face, but I be a flame
Though you're not to nelson any place
